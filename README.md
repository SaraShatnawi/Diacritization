# Introduction
We propose a diacritic restoration framework for speech data. Unlike traditional text-based methods, this model leverages the power of both speech and text. It utilizes a fine-tuned pre-trained automatic speech recognition model (Whisper) to generate an initial, noisy diacritized version of the speech transcript. This noisy transcript is then combined with the original text and fed into a diacritic restoration model.  The proposed approach achieved significant improvements in diacritic restoration performance compared to text-only models, paving the way for more robust speech-based diacritic restoration.
